# x402 v2 Subscription-like Payments (Go)

A complete, runnable **x402 v2** example in Go — **facilitator + resource server + client** —
that implements **subscription-like payments** with the **batch-settlement** EVM scheme.

Built on the official [`x402-foundation/x402`](https://github.com/x402-foundation/x402) Go SDK
(`github.com/x402-foundation/x402/go/v2`).

## Why batch-settlement = "subscription-like"

The default x402 `exact` scheme is pay-per-request: one signed authorization → one onchain
transaction per call. That's fine for the occasional purchase, but expensive and slow for a
metered API an agent hits hundreds of times.

**Batch-settlement** turns that into a prepaid subscription via a **unidirectional payment
channel**:

| Phase | What happens | Onchain? |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| **Subscribe** | Subscriber deposits a prepaid balance into an escrow contract (auto, on the 1st request). | ✅ one deposit tx |
| **Use** | Each request bumps a **cumulative off-chain voucher** (an EIP-712 signature) sent in the payment header. | ❌ signature only |
| **Bill** | The server periodically **claims** accumulated vouchers and **settles** them to itself in batches. | ✅ batched, amortized |
| **Cancel** | Cooperative **refund** returns the unused balance to the subscriber. | ✅ one refund tx |

So the subscriber pays gas ~once (the deposit is even gas-sponsored by the facilitator), then
gets unlimited sub-second, gas-free calls billed against their prepaid balance — exactly the
economics of a prepaid subscription. It also supports **usage-based metering**: the subscriber
authorizes a per-call *maximum*, and the server bills only what was actually consumed.

Each directory is its own Go module and requires `github.com/x402-foundation/x402/go/v2`
(pinned to `v2.18.0`). The `go.work` file lets you build them together locally.

## Prerequisites

- **Go 1.24+**
- Two funded **Base Sepolia** test wallets (private keys):
  - **Facilitator wallet** — needs a little **ETH** for gas (it submits every onchain tx).
  - **Subscriber wallet** — needs **USDC** (the prepaid balance). Deposits are gas-sponsored,
    so it does *not* need ETH.
- A receiver address for the server (can be any address you control).
- Base Sepolia RPC (default `https://sepolia.base.org`) and testnet USDC
  (Circle faucet: <https://faucet.circle.com>).

> The batch-settlement contract must be deployed on the target network. It ships on
> **Base Sepolia (`eip155:84532`)** and **Base Mainnet (`eip155:8453`)**.

## Quick start (3 terminals)

### 1. Facilitator

```bash
cd facilitator
cp .env.example .env
#   EVM_PRIVATE_KEY = facilitator wallet (needs ETH for gas)
go run .
# → Facilitator listening on http://localhost:4022
```

### 2. Resource server (subscription API)

```bash
cd server
cp .env.example .env
#   EVM_ADDRESS   = receiver address (where revenue settles)
#   FACILITATOR_URL = http://localhost:4022
#   EVM_RECEIVER_AUTHORIZER_PRIVATE_KEY = a key you control (recommended)
go run .
# → Unibase Pro subscription API listening at http://localhost:4021
#     GET /v1/health   (free)
#     GET /v1/insights (metered, up to $0.01/call)
```

### 3. Subscriber client

```bash
cd client
cp .env.example .env
#   EVM_PRIVATE_KEY = subscriber wallet (needs USDC)
#   NUMBER_OF_REQUESTS=5
go run .
```

You'll see the first request open the channel (deposit + voucher) and the rest settle as pure
off-chain vouchers in well under a second each. The server logs `[claim]` / `[settle]` as its
`ChannelManager` folds the vouchers onchain in batches.

To simulate **cancelling** and reclaiming the unused balance, set `REFUND_AFTER_REQUESTS=true`
(and optionally `REFUND_AMOUNT` for a partial refund) in `client/.env`.

---

## The facilitator API

The facilitator exposes the three standard x402 endpoints and holds **no custody** — funds live
in the escrow contract; every transition is authorized by an EIP-712 signature.

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `GET /supported` | Advertises schemes, networks, and (optional) `receiverAuthorizer`. |
| `POST /verify` | Off-chain voucher signature + channel-state check. No tx. |
| `POST /settle` | Submits the onchain tx (deposit / batched claim+settle / refund). |

Two keys drive it:
- **`EVM_PRIVATE_KEY`** — the wallet that signs and broadcasts transactions (pays gas).
- **`EVM_RECEIVER_AUTHORIZER_PRIVATE_KEY`** *(optional)* — signs `ClaimBatch`/`Refund` messages
  advertised under `/supported`. Omit it to require servers to run their own authorizer
  (recommended: the server's channels then survive a facilitator change).

---

## Using Coinbase CDP's hosted facilitator instead

You don't have to run the Go facilitator — the server/client just need a `FACILITATOR_URL`.
The SDK's `HTTPFacilitatorClient` points at any URL and supports auth headers via an
`AuthProvider`:

```go
import x402http "github.com/x402-foundation/x402/go/v2/http"

facilitator := x402http.NewHTTPFacilitatorClient(&x402http.FacilitatorConfig{
    URL:          "https://api.cdp.coinbase.com/platform/v2/x402", // CDP v2 base
    AuthProvider: myCdpAuthProvider,                               // supplies CDP API-key headers
})
```

- **Testnet, no key:** the public `https://x402.org/facilitator` works for standard schemes.
- **Production:** CDP (`/v2/x402/verify`, `/v2/x402/settle`) with a CDP API key via `AuthProvider`.

> ⚠️ Batch-settlement is a newer scheme. Before relying on a hosted facilitator for it, check
> that its `GET /supported` actually advertises the `batched` scheme for your network. Running
> the Go facilitator in this repo guarantees batch-settlement support end-to-end.

## Production notes

- **Withdraw delay:** set `DEFERRED_WITHDRAW_DELAY_SECONDS` comfortably larger than your claim
  cadence plus an operational safety margin.
- **Self-managed authorizer:** have the server hold its own `receiverAuthorizer` key (ideally in
  a KMS/HSM — the local ECDSA signer in `server/signer.go` is a placeholder) so channels aren't
  bound to one facilitator.
- **Refund policy:** the demo refunds channels idle for 3 minutes. In production, drive refunds
  from an explicit "cancel subscription" event, not pure idleness.
- **Facilitator hardening:** the `facilitatorEvmSigner` uses naive nonce/gas handling and a fixed
  gas limit — add real nonce management, gas estimation, retries, and monitoring before mainnet.
- **Persistence:** set `STORAGE_DIR` on both server and client so subscriptions survive restarts.
